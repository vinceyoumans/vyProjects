# VY Projects

A running list of what I am currently working on

This site is maintained in HUGO. Hosted on Netlify.


# My TEch Stack includes that following:

## CLOUD

- AWS - I have an AWS Arch Associate certification
    Lambdas and Docker Containers.


- Google - Because it just rocks


- FIREBASE -  Because it just rocks for Mobile and COnsumer front end stuff.


- Digital Ocean - Because its a very affordable place to host DOcker and K8s solutions


## Technology


- GoLang, because everything else is just a working Prototype to be rebuilt serverless on containerized in GoLang.


- HUGO as a site generator... because it does everything that I want to see in a DRUPAL system, but its all static.


- FLUTTER. Because its a fantastic mobile platform with great promice for WEB.


- RUST. for doing WEBAssembly stuff.  Althought I have done very little.


- SWIFT and KOTLIN for mobile.


- vue.js for web apps.


EOS.IO because, for block chain, it just as a very elegant feel to it.
